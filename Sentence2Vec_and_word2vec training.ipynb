And as well for folks on the phone, it is that time of the year in case we do not meet in the next few weeks, then I wish you the very best for the holidays and we'll see you in the New Year. Thank you.\n",

So, hopefully, we've been able to do this call in sufficient time. I'm very happy with the quarter. The teams right across the world 83,000 strong continue to deliver for all of our stakeholders and I look forward to talking to you folks again in the next 90 days or so.

      "ERROR:root:Cannot extract name and title from Victor Dodig President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce Oh, thank you. Excellent. I wanted to just close with a couple remarks before we wrap up the call. Strategically, this is an important quarter for us as we focus on building a relationship-oriented bank for a modern world. We demonstrated the strength of our CIBC franchise through solid core business performance, the merits of our diversified and interconnected franchise and I can't overemphasize that enough, and the success of our U.S. strategy.  Our U.S. business now contributes about 15% to our earnings compared to just 7% prior to The PrivateBank acquisition. We have a best-in-class Commercial Banking business, a Private Wealth business with over CAD 50 billion in assets under management, and a Private Banking business connecting the two. Our CIBC franchise is well-positioned to serve the private economy, centered around midmarket companies and we'll continue investing to build on this position of strength.  Organic efforts will continue to be our core focus, though we will consider inorganic opportunities in a disciplined manner where they make both strategic and financial sense. We are very pleased with the strategic progress across all our businesses, and in particular, with the performance of our Commercial Banking businesses on both sides of the border and the benefits that we're seeing from the connectivity to our Capital Markets business. This approach is working well and providing real value for both our clients and our shareholders.  We're also pleased with the balanced growth and overall performance of our retail bank. We continue to see opportunities to deepen our relationships with clients in this business, delivering sustainable growth on both sides of the balance sheet. Going forward, we will continue to invest for growth as we build a strong client-focused platform across North America. These investments will enable us to transform our bank, and maintain the capital and balance sheet strength to support our clients and our growth going forward. Underpinning all of our efforts is a clear focus on our clients and a long-term view of our business.  In closing, on behalf of CIBC's Executive Committee and our board, I'd like to thank all of our shareholders for their continued support and interest in our bank, and all of CIBC's 44,000 team members for their dedication to serving our clients each and every day. Have a good day and thank you for being here today.\n",

      "ERROR:root:Cannot extract name and title from David I. McKay President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Royal Bank of Canada So why don't I wrap up? Thanks everyone for joining the call today. I think from the themes, from all the questions and the responses you heard from the business leaders, we've got a lot of momentum and we've invested in growth. You've seen that in our revenue line. We feel we're operating in good economic conditions. We still feel there's tailwinds on margins from rates in both of our Canadian and U.S. businesses. We feel we're in a strong credit environment and, going into 2019, having invested in growth, in technology and frontline people as you've heard, we're feeling good about the outlook for the economy and for the bank. So, that's kind of the themes that we wanted to communicate and came out, I hope, with your questions.  So, thank you and we'll see you again in Q1.\n",

      "ERROR:root:Cannot extract name and title from Victor G. Dodig President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce All right. Well, thank you for joining the IFRS 9 call. I think the questions were all very, very good. The challenge of being first in explaining this new accounting methodology is something that we strive to provide the greatest granularity on. It sort of reminds me of the Rubik's Cube when it first came out. Lots of questions, but all solvable. And that's what I think you'll find as you refine your models and you get a better understanding of how we use IFRS 9 in our business and accounting for our business.  So I think what I would like to do is just anchor you in the results again and the strong results for the first quarter for our bank. And they're really a reflection of our focus on the strategic priorities that we laid out for you at Investor Day in December, and to remind you of what are the key areas of focus for us as a leadership team. The first is to continue to focus on the right balance between technology and relationships for our clients. It's not all about technology, it's not all about relationships, but getting that mix of high touch and high tech banking right is what's going to help us give us a competitive advantage in the marketplace and continue to drive revenue across all our businesses for CIBC.  The second is that capital allocation is going to be largely focused on organic growth across all of our platforms. We're going to over-index on the Commercial Bank and Wealth Management, both Canada and the United States where we see significant opportunities for continued growth. And we're going to continue to focus. This is the third important point on getting our efficiency ratio down to the competitive level that we foresee getting to a steady state of 55% over the course of the next year and working toward a 52% mix ratio by 2022.  So, to wrap up, we've got a strong leadership in place – team in place. We're really, really focused on our relationship-based strategy to build a scalable North American bank with high-quality diversified earnings growth. I want to thank the entire team at CIBC, who are incredibly focused on our clients and delivering value to our shareholders and delivering value to the communities that we operate each and every day. And I also want to thank you for all your very good questions. The questions are really, really good. If you feel like there's any blanks to fill, you know that we're always available for you after this call to make sure that you have the full granularity you need to understand our business. Thank you again. And have a good day.\n",

      "ERROR:root:Cannot extract name and title from Darryl White Chief Executive Officer & Director, Bank of Montreal Well thanks, operator, and thank you to all of you for your questions. I'll close just with a quick framing comment. Last quarter I talked about the confidence we have in all of our businesses and the commitment to achieving the financial targets that we spoke to you about, and that confidence continues. As you've heard today, we have momentum in our U.S. P&C business. That's driving very strong results in our Canadian P&C business which is delivering good and consistent underlying earnings growth. Wealth Management had one of its strongest quarters, and the outlook as you heard from Pat for Capital Markets in the second half of the year is good. So as a result, we are on track to achieving our operating leverage target as Tom said for the third year in a row. Bank's performance this quarter I believe is indicative of our potential and I remain confident that our diversified businesses will deliver sustainable earnings growth for the future.  So thank you to everyone for your time in joining the call today. We look forward to speaking to you again in August and at our Investor Day in October. Thanks, everyone.\n",

      "ERROR:root:Cannot extract name and title from Victor G. Dodig President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce Thank you, operator. It seemed like everybody was celebrating their birthday today since you all asked at least two questions. So, thank you for that. Almost ran out of cake. Anyway, CIBC is entering fiscal 2016 (sic) [2018] (57:09) with a very strong capital position, a set of strategic initiatives that we believe will deliver organic growth and a platform in the U.S. to better serve our clients, both our Canadian clients banking in the U.S. and importantly the clients that were banking today and would like to bank in the United States.  We're transforming CIBC into a relationship-focused bank that's built for an increasingly digital world. We understand the impact of technology, but we place great emphasis on the benefit of long-term client relationships, and that's what you're seeing in terms of the growth of our business – high-quality and deeper relationships. And our goal is to deliver diversified growth on both sides of the balance sheet by becoming that primary financial institution for more of our clients and attracting more new clients to CIBC.  As you know, we'll be providing a detailed update on core elements of our strategy at our Investor Day on December 13. We're looking forward to sharing our plans with you and taking all your questions. For those who can't attend in person, the event is going to be available via webcast and the details are outlined in a news release that went out today and posted on cibc.com.  So, to wrap up, I'd like to thank our shareholders and our investors and our analysts for their continued support, trust and interest in our bank. On behalf of CIBC's Executive Committee and our board, I'd especially like to thank CIBC's 45,000 team members for their ongoing dedication to serving our 11 million clients. I'm very proud of the work our team is doing to put our clients at the center of all that we do – to deliver value to our shareholders and to give back to our communities. So thank you, everyone, for being on the call and best wishes for the holiday season.\n",

      "ERROR:root:Cannot extract name and title from Victor G. Dodig President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce Thanks, operator, and thanks to all of you for all your questions. So I just wanted to highlight a couple of key takeaways from our third quarter results and comment on our bank's outlook. We delivered strong quality results this quarter. I think that's evident across all of our business lines in a diversified fashion. We did that while managing our costs very well, and we delivered positive operating leverage as a result of that of 4%.  So, as we look forward and you look at the macro environment both in Canada and the United States, we see it as supportive with respect to having a stable economy, expecting further interest rate increases both north and south of the border. We're very conscious of the uncertainties and challenges related to trade protectionism that face us and face our clients, and we're going to help them navigate through whatever result comes out of these negotiations.  My own belief is that rational minds will prevail and we'll get the trade agreements put in place because all of us are dependent on the trade flows and the economic flows for the well-being of our clients and our countries, specifically with respect to NAFTA. Our strategy for sustainable growth is built on prudently managing our risk and prudently deploying our capital to create value for our shareholders.  So, as we maintain a focus on profitable growth through deepening client relationships, we're also fundamentally rethinking how we invest our capital to make sure that we're aligned with our most important business objectives. We're on target to meet our efficiency ratio of 55% by the end of 2019. I think Kevin Glass reinforced that in his answer to you, and our goal is to get to 52% by the end of 2022. We think that that is an achievable number.  Credit conditions remain stable, as you heard in Laura's comments, and we expect to deliver EPS growth that we've telegraphed to you in every opportunity of between 5% and 10% in terms of range on EPS growth. We'll continue to refocus – to focus on reinvesting our capital in terms of organic growth and maintaining a CET1 ratio that hovers around 11% range. When it comes to excess capital, it's all about organic investment. It's about share buybacks. It's about dividend increases that are well within the 40% to 50% target payout range. It's very clear to all of us here at CIBC that we're in a path to transform our bank into a North American client-focused bank that's positioned for a modern world, a modern world where technology is important but high-touch client relationships are equally important. We've demonstrated a track record of delivering this with 16 quarters of consecutive year-over-year EPS growth, and I think our results speak for themselves.  And to wrap up, I'd like to thank our team, my team, the CIBC team for their dedication to providing exceptional service to our clients and to our shareholders. Thank you for your continued support and confidence in our bank. We look forward to providing you with our year end results at the end of November. Have a good day.\n",

This is my last call and it's so seldom Jill gets asked a question. I'm glad you're able to finish that way.  I want to take a moment to express my personal appreciation for the support of the many stakeholders of the bank over the last decade. And I'll start by thanking the analysts and portfolio managers who regularly participate in these calls for both your engagement and the candid feedback that you provide us, to the bank's employees who put our brand and values into action every day, our bank's ability to adapt, renew, and grow in relevance everywhere we do business is a direct reflection of your commitment to our customers.  I'd also like to recognize the strength of our executive team, and in particular, Darryl White, who have proven their ability to deliver results. It's been a great honor and privilege to lead this organization. I have every confidence that under Darryl's leadership, the bank will build on our track record of success in the service to our customers. Thanks very much and good bye.\n",

      "ERROR:root:Cannot extract name and title from Victor G. Dodig President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce Thanks very much, operator. So, let me just close with a few remarks. Our strong results this quarter reflect the continuing success of our client-focused strategy and our ability to generate sustainable organic growth. I want to emphasize that. We're going to build on this momentum going forward with our overriding focus on putting our clients at the center of all that we do, as we continue to transform CIBC into the relationship-oriented bank for modern world.  We'll continue to execute against the commitments we made to you. And those commitments are: First, to instill a strong, client-focused culture. Whether those relationships are high touch and focused on ideas and advice, or whether they're primary, digital and high tech, we're getting the balance right at CIBC, and we're always doing the right thing for our clients.  Second, we're continuing to diversify our platform for growth. We will continue to bring the strength of our broader franchise to bear in our growing presence in the United States.  The third is we're going to remain really disciplined around our approach to capital deployment. We went through the math on the buyback. We went through our comments on executing on it imminently. And we're primarily focused on organic growth with only complementary tuck-in acquisitions, as those appear in the near term.  And, finally, on efficiency, and this is an important point, we're taking a very disciplined view to managing our cost base. And the bottom line is we drive to our next efficiency target of 52% in 2022.  So, I want to close with a note of thanks. To our CIBC team, our ongoing success is the result of our unrelenting focus on our clients in all the markets and where we serve them. Together, our team is ensuring that CIBC is a leading North American bank that delivers high-quality and sustainable earnings growth. And I'd like to thank our entire team for their continued leadership and contributions to our bank.  And finally, to you, our shareholders and our investors, thank you for your continued support and confidence, and your investment in CIBC. Have a great day.\n",

      "ERROR:root:Cannot extract name and title from David I. McKay President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Royal Bank of Canada I want to thank everyone for their questions. I think the themes that you've heard over the last hour are consistent that we're feeling good about our growth. We're feeling good about the pipeline of growth and continuing that momentum. We have seen good margin improvement, and we're expecting to see even a little bit better margin improvement over the year.  You're going to see a little bit better cost control and better operating leverage out of the bank going forward, and with the constructive economies that we're working in, in our primary markets of Canada, the U.S. and Europe, we still are forecasting, as you saw from our 25 basis points to 30 basis points range, there's a fairly benign credit environment. So, we're feeling good about the operating momentum we have and look to continue to perform. So, thank you, and we'll see you again in Q3.\n",

Masrani Group President and Chief Executive Officer, The Toronto-Dominion Bank Thank you, operator, and thank you to all of you for joining us today. I know this was little earlier than before, but I'm told by Riaz and Gillian that this was in response to some of the feedback we were receiving. So, hopefully, we've been able to do this call in sufficient time. I'm very happy with the quarter. The teams right across the world 83,000 strong continue to deliver for all of our stakeholders and I look forward to talking to you folks again in the next 90 days or so. So thanks for joining us and enjoy the little bit of the summer that is still left. All the best.\n",

      "ERROR:root:Cannot extract name and title from Victor G. Dodig President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce Thanks, operator. And thanks, everyone. Nobody ever wishes a bank happy birthday, so it's our birthday this year. It's the country's birthday. I thought I'd just share a few remarks before we wrap up the call that we at CIBC here share a very proud and longstanding history with our country that traces back to 1867, the year of our country's Confederation. We've had the privilege of helping clients, helping communities and businesses prosper and grow for 150 years and I hope all of you will join us in celebrating our sesquicentennial Canada Day celebrations we've planned across our great nation.  Some of you should also be probably go into our modern branches and maybe see what they're like. CIBC will be involved in 20 Canada Day celebrations coast to coast to coast, at least one in each province and territory, and that's going to help create a ripple effect of pride and excitement for both our teams and our communities and our clients. As a proud Canadian company, we've contributed to building our nation into one of the best in the world. We're committed to ensuring our communities continue to be a great place to live and work for the next 150 years.  To continue our investment in Toronto as Canada's financial capital, I think you all know that we recently announced that we'll be the anchor tenants in a new world-class urban campus that will serve as our new headquarters and home for approximately 15,000 of our bank employees in the Greater Toronto area. Over the course of the development, this development itself will create more than 4,000 construction-related jobs in the Greater Toronto area. This urban campus development will be modern, it'll be tech-enabled, it's going to foster collaboration, it's going to help us attract the best and retain the best talent.  We're building a modern innovative bank that puts our clients at the center of everything we do and we're very excited to bring that to life for our own team not only with our new headquarters but everything that we're doing and investing in CIBC.  In closing, I want to thank our team for another strong quarter and everything that they do for our clients. And also, I want to thank our shareholders and the analyst community for your continued support. Have a great day.\n",

One hour and 15 minutes, I think that's a record for us, at least a recent record. Before we wrap, I wanted to just do a couple of things. I wanted to announce that we're going to hold our next Investor Day on the 13th of December in Toronto. We look forward to this opportunity to introduce you to our new leadership team. And what we'd like to do is provide you with a perspective on what we told you almost two and a half years ago in terms of what we're going to deliver and give you a perspective going forward on what we intend to deliver for you as our shareholders.  And for those of you who are able to join us, we're gearing up for another successful CIBC Run for the Cure on the 1st of October. It's a cause our team across our country and our clients very much are passionate about, and we hope to see you there.  And in closing, I'd like to thank CIBC's team members for everything you do for our clients, our shareholders and our communities. And I also like to thank you our investors for your continued support and confidence and good questions about our bank. Have a great day.\n",

Just before we finish, I'd like to comment on this morning's announcement that Mark Hughes has decided to retire in April, after 37 years at RBC, and there will be many opportunities to recognize him over the coming months. But I'd like to take this moment to thank him for his significant contributions to the Bank, to our clients and our shareholders. And on personal note, I want to thank Mark for his incomparable counsel and partnership over the years.  I'm pleased that Graeme Hepworth, currently Executive Vice President of Retail & Commercial Risk will take on the role of Deputy Chief Risk Officer in February and then assume the role of Chief Risk Officer in April 2018, when Mark retires.  Graeme has been with RBC for 20 years and held progressively senior roles in our Risk Management Group. He brings a deep expertise in Risk as well as experience working across multiple businesses and regions. So he's well-positioned for his new role. I want to thank everyone for attending our call today. I wish you a happy and healthy holiday season, and we'll see you in Q1, in February 2018. Thanks very much, everyone.\n",

Before I end the call, as Mark mentioned, it is his last official quarterly call. And I just wanted to sincerely, on behalf of all our stakeholders, our investors, our employees, our clients, thank Mark for an outstanding 37 years. He has served our organization and our shareholders exceptionally well and done just a wonderful job. So, congratulations on a great career.  And as we said, with Graeme taking over, we know we're in great risk hands. I'd also like to mention that we will hold a Canadian retail focused Investor Day on June 13, where we'll discuss some innovation initiatives that we've been talking about in the market as well as our strategy to provide greater value to customers. We hope to see you there.  In summary, I think you saw a very strong performance volume growth, margin increases, good cost control, relatively benign credit environment, strong ROEs. We're really happy with our Q1 performance and the momentum we have.  Thanks, everyone, and have a good day.\n",

      "ERROR:root:Cannot extract name and title from Victor G. Dodig President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce Sorry again. Me again just for two more minutes. So, just thanks, operator. We had a very strong year in 2018, a very strong top line growth across all four of our business units, all driven by a very client-focused strategy. As we look into 2019, the macroeconomic environment both in Canada and the United States may moderate as we enter what we see as the mature end of the credit cycle. In addition, as we've talked about during this call, there are geopolitical tensions that we hope get resolved, but if we don't, we'll manage – if they don't, we'll manage through them.  As we go forward, we expect rising rate environment, which will be also compounded by GDP growth that will likely be moderated. North and south of the border, we expect the United States to outperform Canada until some of our structural issues are resolved in this part of the world. Against this backdrop, we're just going to continue to focus on our strategy and focus on our clients. We're going to focus on profitable growth, deepening client relationships.  We're going to focus on transforming our cost base, both to deliver earnings per share growth and to reinvest in our businesses. We've laid out for you targets at two investor days already, all of which have been met and/or exceeded on the cost side, and our medium-term goal for our mix ratio is 22% – 52%. 22% is impossible. I don't want to mislead any of you. We're going to hit the 55% next year and we'll get to 52% in 2022.  When it comes to deploying our capital, we're going to make sure we're smart and diligent about our capital ratios. We want to make sure we have a strong CET1 to give us flexibility in challenging environments. We want to make sure we can deliver on dividend increases that are well within our payout range. And while we're cautious about the macroeconomic environment, we're confident that we'll achieve our earnings growth in our target range of 5% to 10%. So, we're well positioned for the future.  In closing, I'm very pleased with the progress we've made, very pleased with the progress we've made to building CIBC into a North American client-focused bank that understands where technology is going, but always maintains the interests of our clients at the forefront of everything that we do.  So, on behalf of our executive committee, our board, and our leadership team, I want to thank all of you, our investors and our shareholders, for all your continued support, and I'd like to thank our 44,000 team members who are working for our clients each and every day. And at this point in the year, I'd also like to wish all of you a happy holiday season, best in the New Year. I look forward to talking to you again in February. Cheers.\n",

I would characterize it as a strong quarter that diversification or diversity of our franchise really showed through in a quarter that had significant volatility particularly in December that impacted our capital markets activity levels, that impacted, certainly impacted our AUM, AUA, AUC levels across our I&TS, and Wealth Management franchises. But underlying all that is significant client momentum, market share gains and great core activity that we were able to earn through. So we feel as we pointed out very good about the activity levels in our business and the momentum our business has, heading to the rest of year end, kind of remain confidence in our medium-term outlook for the business. So thanks for your questions and we'll talk to you next quarter.\n",

And finally, in case, folks on the phone, if we don't get together, happy holidays to you and your families, and we will see you in the New Year. Thanks very much.\n",

Masrani Group Head-U.S. Personal & Commercial Banking, The Toronto-Dominion Bank Thank you, operator, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this afternoon.  I know, Bob had a lot of questions, I thought I should comment on that. We, at TD Securities, obviously had a rough quarter in Q1, but we have the strategy we have committed to, we believe in this strategy, and you should see us continuing to build out the dealer as outlined by Bob, with the right investments. And so, it is a core part of TD and we are happy that we are not going to change and make any dramatic shifts because of one quarterly event. In fact, our business for many, many years, given the type of business we've been doing, with the risk appetite we have set, has been consistent, and has delivered what you would expect from the dealer at TD.  So, once again, thank you for joining and I would like to take this opportunity to thank our 5,000 TD bankers around the world for once again delivering for all of our stakeholders, including our shareholders. Thank you and see you in 90 days.\n",
